# FED2, JS-2 CA

This project is a social media-like web application built using Vite for the frontend and a pre-existing API for handling posts. The app allows users to view, create, edit, and delete posts in a paginated feed. API authentication is handled through an API Key and Bearer Token, and the app uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the API.

- `auth/` - Handles all authentication-related functionality
- `post/` - This directory handles the posts section of the social media-like application.
- `profile/` - This directory is for managing user profiles.
- `public` - This directory contains static assets that are publicly accessible.
- `src` - This is where most of the core application logic resides. With communication with api, routing via vite, javascript for user interface and utility functions.

## API Integration

The app uses a pre-existing API to manage posts, requiring a Bearer Token and API Key for authentication. The token is stored in localStorage and passed in API requests.
